# CS-250-T3285-Software-Development-Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
For more cases, I would say that the needs and wants of a user are different but on this case I would say that they are the same. Personally, I would have to have a base line knowledge of what the user has and then I would be able to better implement the changes or new feature that they want/need. Stories are really useful since they help you organize the ideas.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Before the class, I think I would use a waterfall aproach and hope for the best at the end. Now I would use the incremental release, the constant communication with user for their feedback, and backlog and backlog refinement.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Be hones, be kind, open communication, accept and give constructive criticism, do your part, ask for help.
